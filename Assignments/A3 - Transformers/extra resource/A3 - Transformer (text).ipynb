    "## Transformers and machine learning trends\n",
    "\n",
    "Before the arrival of transformers, CNNs were most often used in the visual domain, while RNNs\n",
    "like LSTMs were most often used in NLP. There were many attempts at crossover, without much real success. Neither approach seemed capable of dealing with very large complex\n",
    "natural language datasets effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2017, the Transformer was introduced. The paper, \"Attention is all you need,\" has now been\n",
    "cited more than 70,000 times.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main concept in a Transformer is self-attention, which replaces the sequential processing of\n",
    "RNNs and the local processing of CNNs with the ability to adaptively extract arbitrary relationships\n",
    "between different elements of its input, output, and memory state.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Transformer architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use [Frank Odom's implementation of the Transformer in PyTorch](https://github.com/fkodom/transformer-from-scratch/tree/main/src).\n",
    "\n",
    "The architecture of the transformer looks like this:\n",

    "## Attention\n",
    "\n",
    "Before Transformers, the standard model for sequence-to-sequence learning was seq2seq, which combines an RNN for encoding with\n",
    "an RNN for decoding. The encoder processes the input and retains important information in a sequence or block of memory,\n",
    "while the decoder extracts the important information from the memory in order to produce an output.\n",
    "\n",
    "One problem with seq2seq is that some information may be lost while processing a long sequence.\n",
    "Attention allows us to focus on specific inputs directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "An attention-based decoder, when we want to produce the output token at a target position, will calculate an attention score\n",
    "with the encoder's memory at each input position. A high score for a particular encoder position indicates that it is more important\n",
    "than another position. We essentially use the decoder's input to select which encoder output(s) should be used to calculate the\n",
    "current decoder output. Given decoder input $q$ (the *query*) and encoder outputs $p_i$, the attention operation calculates dot\n",
    "products between $q$ and each $p_i$. The dot products give the similarity of each pair. The dot products are softmaxed to get\n",
    "positive weights summing to 1, and the weighted average $r$ is calculated as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r = \\sum_i \\frac{e^{p_i\\cdot q}}{\\sum_j e^{p_j\\cdot q}}p_i .$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can think of $r$ as an adaptively selected combination of the inputs most relevant to producing an output.\n",

    "### Multi-head self attention\n",
    "\n",
    "Transformers use a specific type of attention mechanism, referred to as multi-head self attention.\n",
    "This is the most important part of the model. An illustration from the paper is shown below.\n",

    "$$\\text{Attention}(Q,K,V)=\\text{softmax}(\\frac{QK^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}})V$$\n",

    "$Q$, $K$, and $V$ are batches of matrices, each with shape <code>(batch_size, seq_length, num_features)</code>.\n",
    "When we are talking about *self* attention, each of the three matrices in\n",
    "each batch is just a separate linear projection of the same input $\\bar{h}_t^{l-1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiplying the query $Q$ with the key $K$ arrays results in a <code>(batch_size, seq_length, seq_length)</code> array,\n",
    "which tells us roughly how important each element in the sequence is to each other element in the sequence. These dot\n",
    "products are converted to normalized weights using a softmax across rows, so that each row of weights sums to one.\n",
    "Finally, the weight matrix attention is applied to the value ($V$) array using matrix multiplication. We thus get,\n",
    "for each token in the input sequence, a weighted average of the rows of $V$, each of which corresponds to one of the\n",
